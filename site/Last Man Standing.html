<section id="Prologue">
<p class="chapter">1. Prologue</p>
<p>We’ve often mentioned how lucky we were to have our dad in our midst at such a late age, but do we ever give some thought to how he got there? I have, and the only attribute I can attach to this, is his simplicity. Daddy lived a very simple life and would never give a second thought to the desires many of us so often strive for and in my mind, this is what helped him get through the difficulties he faced during his lifetime and there were many.</br>
I wrote this essay to give my children and at some point, their children, an idea of who their grandfather Ernest Christie Varie was and to provide them with an idea of the calibre of the man. I have subsequently decided to provide the entire Varie family with the notes for all to remember him and our mother by and I thought it best done while he is alive for all to appreciate him in his last days. The previous version of this essay was written during his last days on earth.</p> 
<section id="His Childhood challenges">
<p class="chapter">2.	His Childhood challenges.</p>
<p>From my conversations with him I can tell you that Daddy did not have a good start in life and for him difficulties started at a very young age. Being the youngest of four brothers and one sister, he was orphaned at around the age of 4. He has no recollection of his father at all and only has a vivid memory of his mother. Being orphaned resulted in wondering from one place to another, sometimes with and sometimes without the rest of the family. He was eventually taken in by a man whom we learned to know as uncle Joe with his brother John Henry Varie. I met his brother Alfie only when I was already in my teens and Simon and sister Rosemary as a young adult. John was the father of our dearly departed cousin Bisa, who was one of our closest cousins whom we dearly miss and often think and talk about. Bisa and his brother Alfie, I suppose the latter named after our uncle, were the only cousins from Daddy’s side whom we really grew to know well. Uncle Joe did his best to provide for the two brothers, but also under harsh conditions as Daddy told me, ultimately led to his separation from his first wife. I have forgotten the name of the woman, but the stories I heard, involved a lot of physical and mental abuse. Daddy has lots of fond memories of Coronationville Primary school where he attended as a child. He pin-pointed a tree to me many years ago which he planted on the perimeter of the school yard. I often wonder if he would still have been able to identify the tree in his 90’s.<br><br>
Back to the abuse… Daddy explained that the two brothers were being “slave driven” by this woman in this house in Corrie from the time uncle Joe leaves the house in the morning, until his return. Upon his return, things are being made to look as normal as possible. Once uncle Joe leaves the house in the morning, they have to clean and do other chores before going to school without any nourishment. When they return from school, the work continues for them even though the house and yard is already clean. She had a daughter who lived the life of a madam being served upon without ever lifting a finger and gradually adopted the same attitude as her mother. They were often issued with strict instructions not to ask for a second helping when they sit to eat their only (unbeknown to Uncle Joe) meal of the day which was supper, meaning that involuntary fasting was almost part of most their days. This treatment was accompanied by concealed physical force and threats which included should they complain to their uncle, they will end up on the streets they came from. Daddy could not distinguish which was worse, the physical or the mental abuse.</br></br> 
Daddy told me once that his brother would often steal food elsewhere and share it with him during the late hours of the night while all were sleeping. He told me a story once of how his brother John left home discreetly during the middle of one night with a big bunch of keys and returned with a wedding cake which he stole from a bakery somewhere. This cake was never discovered, hidden under the bed as they were the only one’s cleaning the house. He said this was the first wedding cake he has ever eaten and remembered it as was the best wedding cake he has ever eaten.</br></br>  
He told me that John was the person who always gave him hope that life will improve for them. John often talked about leaving the house, but he never did because he did not want to leave Daddy alone in this situation.</br></br>   
After a few years of this abuse, a neighbour eventually confronted and alerted uncle Joe on his observations which shocked uncle Joe tremendously and this consequently ended the marriage. Daddy always respected uncle Joe for choosing them over an abusive woman. John subsequently went his way and continued life with many trials and tribulations. As Daddy explained, they lost contact after a few years and has never physically reconnected since. The last contact was a letter received from prison in which John explained that this may be the last contact between them. John got married and had two children, Bisa and Alfie prior to being incarcerated whom we got to know through a stroke of luck many years later. These were our closest cousins from Daddy’s side. </br>
Some time later Uncle Joe re-married a lady whom we learned to know as Aunty “Funi” whose actual name was Maude. Daddy and his foster brothers, Ernie Petersen and Joela Lourie, were taken in by this lady and we grew up to know them as our uncles as this trio became brothers and grew up as such. Daddy had the utmost respect for this lady and told me that she was the closest to a mother he has ever had. We spent many Sunday afternoons visiting her house commuting by train and I can remember looking forward to these visits, which signifies that we were accepted and treated well. I was very young and approximately 8 years old when Aunt “Funi” passed on, but I remember years later Daddy still reminiscing about this lady and the role she played in his life and how very differently she treated him compared to the previous foster “mother”.</p>
<section id="Becoming a man at an early age">
<p class="chapter">3.	Becoming a man at an early age.</p>
<p>Because of his circumstances, daddy did not continue his early education and started working in a shoe factory in Ophirton, if I remember, it was at the age of 14 or 15. He started evolving into a man at an age much younger than normal during the time let alone the modern era. He explains that he was forced into what we will refer to as child labour these days in order to make a life. He saw this as his way out and earning money was suddenly a new beginning to a new way of life for him. I imagine that under apartheid there were not many avenues available for people of colour 70 odd years ago and I don’t think those in power even cared.<br><br> 
It was in Ophirton where he met our beloved mother Doreen who lived in St. George Street I think, through her brother “Tools” whom he befriended while working at the shoe factory in Ophirton. Daddy and “Tools” were very close friends before he met our mother who then became his close friend. Marilyn, Sabrina and Lynette were all born in Ophirton. I am not certain for how long life in Ophirton continued before Mommy and Daddy moved to a small semi-detached house in Wanderers Street, Newclare. I was very young when “Tools” passed away, however I recall many conversations involving “Tools” long after his death. <br><br>
Daddy often spoke about the good times he shared with Mommy. They would often go to what was called “Snowballs” (a dance at a house with the view on raising funds) and “Lang-arm” dances and travelled on trams to there and back. He often told me that our mother became the only partner he could dance ‘Lang arm” with properly. This to me was an indication of how close their relationship was which signified a partnership in more ways than one.<br><br>  
This relationship produced eight children of which Marilyn is the eldest born in 1954. Having many children was common among people of colour those years and I can only ascribe this to the lack of education and guidance. We may ask how people could manage and afford so many children those years and I bet the answers will be multi-facetted, peculiar and complicated, but at the end of it all, we survived and I bet the reason that we as a family made it through those years was mainly because Daddy’s manhood lessons were delivered to him very early in life. The more I ponder on the life experiences he shared with me, the more I understand him as a person and the character within, which you will learn about as I proceed writing this essay.</p><b>
<section id="A man with regrets and mistakes">
<p class="chapter">4.	A man with regrets and mistakes.</p>
<p>Later in life, Daddy opened up on another side of his earlier life and did not feel the need to conceal this side of himself. I personally did not experience some of what he refers to as his regrets, but I think Marilyn may have some flashes in her distant memory bank. Daddy related that he was no angel for a huge part of his life and he fell victim to what we commonly refer to as “Die Bottle”. Having started his manhood prematurely, he started adult social activity early and at a young age joined the club of drinkers. He recalled in the early years it was moderate and controlled but later in life it became more frequent to the extent where it became daily. He however always noted that during all this, there was never a day when he did not arrive at work and always arrived on time. I recall he mentioned that there was a period for over 20 years when he never missed work for a single day. This to me was astonishing and an indication that he was a man who remembered his responsibilities irrespective of the situation. 
<br><br>
Daddy often reflected that our mother always had patience with him and through her tenaciousness, she managed to absorb this difficulty and he gave her the most credit for the raising and caring for the few children they had at this point. He always mentioned that she blamed the company he kept for the alcohol abuse and his response to her often was that his friends do not pour the liquor down his throat, but she kept believing that he will change back to the person she once knew. </br></br>
He recalled it was at a New Year’s Day picnic at a river of some sort when he consumed more than he normally would. The overconsumption resulted in his collapse in a drunken state away from the spot the group they partied with occupied. He estimates it must have been a few hours before he awoke and noticed that his surroundings were unfamiliar to him as well as the other picnickers in close proximity. What went through his mind at that point, changed his life forever. “What are these people thinking about me” went through his thoughts over and over as he was trying to compose himself. Lynette was a baby at the time and images of her kept flashing in his mind. He eventually lifted himself up and found his way back to his accompanying group. He grabbed the bottle of brandy they were drinking and right there emptied the balance of the content and told everybody that this was the last of his drinking days. He recalled how some joked and thought it was just a momentarily episode and commented that he would soon replenish the bottle he just emptied. As it turned out, many years went by and he has never, ever replenished the bottled he emptied. Now this is the mark of a man who does what he says he is going to do and that is just how we grew up to know Daddy. When he sets his sights on something, he finishes what he starts. I am grateful though that he never finished the drinking journey he started, because nobody ever finishes this journey…, it finishes you.</p>
<section id="His new path and the beginning of another journey">
<p class="chapter">5.	His new path and the beginning of another journey</p>
<p>Having made mention in the previous topic that his life will change forever, I certainly did not mean that life will be a bed of roses, no, it was the beginning of new challenges to deal with. However, the challenges would have been more difficult to deal with if alcohol abuse was still in the frame and this would have applied to us all. Perhaps, we as an entire family must give a thought to the fact that if Daddy did not kick the habit when he did, half of us may not have been on this earth. <br><br>
Back to Newclare…. It was here where Jenny, Diela, and I were born, and I remember life here very vaguely. I still have memories of people like Prakash (Pakas as we called him) and his family who owned the small general dealer shop. I remember my friend Issie and I paddling cars which Daddy and his good friend Uncle Hue (Short for Yusuf) obtained for us. I remember auntie Mary and even her mother who passed away while we lived on the yard. It is here where Daddy met people like uncle Hue and Uncle Kenny. People who with very little resources and opportunities at their disposal tried to make living as normal as possible for their families under the harsh pressures of apartheid. Be it as it may, the vague memories I have are fond memories irrespective, and these memories are fond memories because Daddy tried his best for them to be exactly that.<br><br>     
We moved from Newclare to Western, 220 Noah Street and I suppose the main reason was for bigger and more affordable accommodation. Daddy’s friend uncle Hue, in a similar position, followed suit and also moved to Western with his family. They were the Asvat’s and I think they were the closest in the Varie family history we were to family friends. The bonds created between our parents were close and this rubbed off onto the children. We were close with Fattie, Aggie, Issie and Michelle for a long time as kids but this friendship dwindled as we grew older with the exception of Marilyn and Fattie who still remained close for many years. <br><br>
It was in Noah Street where Shaun was born. I vaguely remember him as a baby in this house which altered the sleeping arrangement and also the chores. I remember one of my chores were to make sure we had coal and wood in the house during the winter months to prevent Daddy from having to do this when a wakes up to start the fire in the coal stove. I am sure Marilyn, Nettie and Sabrina will remember their house cleaning and dish washing chores. Mommy was the strict one around this and I can vaguely remember how she used to drill my sisters to get their chores done which later became easier and more natural to accomplish. <br><br>
Our web of friendships and acquaintances developed in Noah Street where we came to know neighbours like Uncle Popeye and his Wife Aunty Nun and children. Om Bab and his wife Aunt Dorie and children, Ouma Cooku and her grandchildren of whom I remember Derek, Emmy and Angie. There were many more other families whose names elude me, and I am certain my older sisters will be able to recollect much more. Some families were even bigger than ours living in confined spaces which we all became so accustomed to. We saw it as the norm as we did not know any better by virtue of the evils of apartheid. With oppression and apartheid at its highest point, we as kids, could not see the pressure this placed on Daddy and many others like him as it was beyond our understanding, but he pushed on to do his best to provide. He did his best under hugely trying circumstances to raise us as a normal family. In hindsight, I still find it so difficult to comprehend how it was possible to raise so many under such difficult conditions and in an abnormal environment like Western. Abnormal because of the non-existing infrastructures and facilities apartheid presented to black people. We had no electricity, one outside tap only for cold water, dilapidated housing structures, non-existing sanitization, unhygienic environments, no proper road infrastructures. Yes, abnormal because the poorest of white’s were living in conditions which appeared like heaven to us. Apartheid was a system designed for people like Daddy and others like him to falter and not progress but stagnate, but Daddy did not allow this. His focus was always on his family and its survival.<br><br>   
Life in Noah Street was about a 3-year episode when we then moved further up the township to 2221 Mabeta Street. It is here where Ursula was born. She is the “last born”. I recall the attention she received was much more intense and closer and this was from everyone not just Mommy and Daddy. Daddy always referred to her as “my hart se punt”. Now I can tell you that I got a lot of hidings from Mommy and Daddy and most of it was deserved because I know I was mischievous, but I cannot recall Ursula ever getting “pak slae”. Well, I cannot say whether it was because she was so beautiful or because she was such an angel, but one thing was for sure, she was his “hart se punt” as he often referred to her. <br><br>   
Again, moving to Mabeta was an effort for bigger accommodation as the family has now grown in numbers and stature. This house was much better than all the previous places as it had potential for improvement and extensions. Even the yard was more accommodating for playing although confined. It was here from my memory where our acquaintance with the Bagus family evolved. This used to be the house they lived in and I remember Daddy telling me that between him and Uncle Moosa they pulled some strings at the local council office for us to get this house when the Bagus family moved to the newly built area which was to become Westbury. These houses were built with improved infrastructures, like electricity, inhouse bathrooms, tarred roads and hot water. This was upmarket compared to the normal standards we were accustomed to. It was referred to as “Die nuwe huise” and 45+ years on still maintains the same reference although newer units were built many years later.  <br><br>
At some point during the early years of the Mabeta occupation, I recall Jenny and I having to attend Sunday school which has become something of a new phenomenon to us as we were not part of a church congregation prior. Daddy had realized that the missing element in his family unit at this point was spiritual stimulation. I recall Reverend Kirkman from the Westbury Congregational Church coming to our house to perform a home baptism on myself, Jenny, Diela and Shaun. This was required before we could become full members of the church. Daddy explained to me years later that this was not normally done at home and he managed to persuade the Reverend and Archie the deacon who along with his wife Beatie became close spiritual family friends for many years, to do it this way as he wanted it to remain private. I assume the 1st half of the family kids were baptized a few years earlier elsewhere and somewhere the bond with the church dissipated. I remember Daddy spending time praying on his bed every night from this point and still did until his last days on earth. I learned years later that Mommy was a Congregationalist and I understood then where the initiative came from for this specific church, and I believe she was the inspiration behind this motivation for us to be raised with a spiritual background. <br><br>
As things turned out and I cannot remember the detail, Daddy’s stint at Vulcan shoe factory came to an end and he joined another shoe factory called Star Footwear in Industria. Also, there he worked for a few years and again without missing a day’s work. This once again illustrated his commitment to his family which was in my opinion and in hindsight unquestionable. <br><br>
We reached a point when Marilyn, after completing her JC at Coronationville High school went to Nursing college and saw this as perhaps a direction for her to pursue. I recall seeing her in that nursing uniform and looked at her with pride as she resembled humanity to me. I saw the humane side of her that time already. She, however, did not see this through as I remember her mentioning that the gruesome side of the responsibilities of being nurse was too much to handle and understandably so. Benevolent, she remained, however. Marilyn went to work for OK Bazaars in Rosebank and with her being able to support herself made the load slightly easier for Daddy and I remember how he recognised her with pride. I will always respect Marilyn for as long as I live because I could see at a young age how she contributed to the upkeep of the household. Her contribution to our livelihood during a certain part of her life will remain with me forever. I recall the time when she was still on a weekly cash wage when her envelope was stolen out of her locker. This placed a huge strain on her, and she had to deal with this loss both psychologically and emotionally. I also remember Mommy and Daddy trying their best to deal with her emotional state and in their untrained way calmed the waters and eventually she overcame this episode, but I bet she will never forget the incident.<br><br>    
Daddy explained that Star Footwear ran into some financial problems and the company faced liquidation. This placed a lot of strain on him, and I did not realize at the time the pressure he was under as he did not show it and I am certain he did not want his children to notice it. During the closing process of this firm, he told me, there was an enquiry from United Boot and Shoe which later became United Fram, for a Laster (a specific skill used to operate a lasting machine during the manufacture of shoes). He recalled there were many who made enquiries for the vacancy but United emphasized that they are after a certain individual and that person he was informed a few days later, was him. The owner of United came to see him at Star Footwear and informed him that he comes highly recommended, and he was offered a job, which he under the circumstances, had no option but to gratefully accept. This took a huge burden off his shoulders, and he associated this development to the power of prayer as he did not even have to go and find a job, it found him. I, however, also attest this to the mark of the man as he was, the kind of person who believed in doing things the right way and to the best of his ability and this is what made him visible to others.</p>
<section id="Fighting for his life">
<p class="chapter"> 6.	Fighting for his life. </p>  
<p> I must have been around 12 or 13 years old when if I remember Daddy was standing in the kitchen when he was hit by a sudden pain somewhere on his back. He must have been only 45 years old if my calculations are correct. Mommy came to his aid and helped him to bed and nursed him for a while to relief the pain. We were all concerned as this was the first time, we witnessed Daddy in some form of agony. I do not know what happened through the night but during the early hours of the next morning Daddy decided he will not go to work that day and he would rather go to hospital. Our good neighbour Uncle Penny, with whom he formed a good friendship with over many years drove him to hospital. I suspect it must have been on Mommy’s insistence because knowing him, he would have forced himself to work. The doctor who attended to him and after running some tests gave him the news that he suffered a mild heart attack. What follows next was life changing and drastic changes were required. <br><br>
He told me the conversation with the doctor was to the point, direct and straight forward from the doctor’s perspective. Reality set in very quickly. The doctor was blunt and told him, "this not my life we’re talking about here, it’s yours. I am well and you are not”. The instruction from the doctor was that he stops smoking immediately or the next attack will be on the severe side and could be fatal. He said what went through his mind immediately at the time was the children. “What will happen to us if he has to be removed from the equation?” was his primary thought and concern, acknowledging that the majority of the troop are girls. But this was not the only synopsis, he was also diagnosed as a diabetic and with hypertension, which meant having to go onto an eating plan with immediate effect. Having to cut down on most of the fatty foods and sugary drinks he enjoyed so much since kicking the bottle was the easy part. Smoking was the main part of the imminent changes which he knew was going to be the most difficult, but he was resolute on doing it for the sake of his children. He never smoked another cigarette again since and with the support of our mother, he stuck to an eating plan for years which prevented a similar episode until his last day. He told me many times if Mommy was not by his side, it would have been much more difficult. In solidarity, she also stopped smoking for a long time but unfortunately, she did not have the same will power and picked up the habit again a few years later. The habit was detrimental and lead to her premature departure from this earth.<br><br>
This episode in Daddy’s life once again illustrated his disciplined and principled attitude towards challenges that came his way. He never gave a second thought when it came to his family’s livelihood. He always wanted what was best for everybody and not just himself. In my view, he decided that from this point he is fighting for his life. The only difference is that he was fighting for his life standing up and not lying down.</p><br>
<section id="Respected by many">
<p class="chapter">7.	Respected by many.</p>
<p> Over the years many of Daddy’s old friends continued to visit our house. They would come with the drinks or sometimes he would entertain them. I remember names like Wiela, Geoff, Georgie Hobbs and many more who were his friends. So often I was told how my father was the only one who could do what he did and turn into the man I remember him to be. I could see the respect shown by old drinking buddies and extended family members alike who did not expect such a turnaround. It was remarkable to see him retain friendships with former fellow drinkers and form new ones with non-drinkers and earn the same respect from friends like, Uncle Hue, Uncle Kenny, Uncle Babba and Uncle Moosa who became probably his closest friend he ever had. I often think of this friendship with him having become a devout Christian and Uncle Moosa a devout Muslim and the huge respect they had for each other and each other’s spiritual beliefs and the rarity of it. They were both outspoken men who expressed their thoughts freely to each other and to others with no reservations. We all pray to the same God is what he believed, and he would never judge a person by his religious persuasion and he expects the same as he beliefs no religion is unjust and all religions teaches forgiveness. He often spoke about his friend Moosa with great respect and still did after his passing and you can often sense the grief for Moosa in his voice. The same emotions which Daddy showed when he spoke about Mommy after her loss so many years later. <br><br>
He was highly respected by his peers and superiors alike where he worked as well. At supervisor level I came across many who worked with him commenting on how strict he was with them, and I could see the respect shown irrespective. <br><br>
During his illustrious career, yes, the working-class people can also have illustrious careers, Daddy worked his way up to a level at United Fram where he was appointed to the position of Quality Controller which made him part of management. He was very proud of this achievement and often remined me that he reached this level with hard work only as this position was normally occupied by those who are learned with at least a matriculation as opposed to him who has never reached high school level. He mastered the skills of shoe manufacturing and quality to such a level that when he retired at the age of 65 in 1994, he was asked to return for a few more years as the quality in the factory deteriorated too much after his retirement. He continued for approximately 3 years before re-retiring permanently. <br><br>
One of the best compliments ever passed, was on a day when I visited Daddy at work, I could have been around 20 years old and while waiting for him, the co-owner of the holding Company Conshu, Allen Feinblum came over for a chat with me and after assessing who I was, commented that “if you become half the man your father is, I will call you a man”. This compliment has stayed with me all my life and I sincerely hope that I have become that. You see, the old saying “respect must be earned and not expected” is exactly what comes to mind. Daddy has done, seen and been through many obstacles and where many have stumbled, he pulled through and this characteristic has been his pillar of strength for him all his life and attributed to the reason why he was respected by many. </p>
<section id="His ultimate loss">
<p class="chapter">8.	His ultimate loss.</p>
<p>As life went on, we as children grew up and a time came when we each had to choose our different paths. I am certain we would have all chosen different paths if life was more generous to us, but we must accept our lot. We must acknowledge that Daddy did his best and be grateful to him and most importantly to God. In everything we did, we could count on the support of both our parents, and I acknowledge that there were many moments when support was required. There were also many happy moments as well. We celebrated marriages, baptisms, birthdays, and lots of family related occasions which were initiated by our parents in the best ways possible. Mommy and Daddy did their best for us to develop as a family unit and their efforts under very difficult conditions grew our family bonds from strength to strength over the years. I can proudly say that our family as big as it was and still is, was one of the best family units in the township and this was made possible by our parents because they had a strong bond which they wanted to transfer onto their children.<br><br> 
I was travelling from Durban sometime in July 1997 when I got the phone call that Mommy fell ill and was taken into hospital with lung infection complications which was unfortunately brought on by her smoking habit. She recovered from this and was released from hospital, and I recall during this time, it was only her second time in hospital. Her first episode was when she was admitted to Baragwanath hospital possibly 30 years prior for something I cannot remember entirely, but involved a skin graft procedure which kept her in hospital for a few days.<br><br>
This time, the hospitalization was more serious and brought a scare over all of us and we were thankful for her recovery, but it was not for long. A few weeks later, she fell ill again and was readmitted to Helen Joseph hospital. This time we were informed was a severe stroke which landed her in the ICU unit in a coma. We were told by doctors that her organs are too weak to put up a fight strong enough to recover and on a certain day after about a week in hospital, we were all advised to prepare for the worst. She passed away on 27 August while in ICU. I will always remember the support shown by my good friend Arthur who was by my side at the hospital at the time.<br><br>
This was a bleak day for all of us and our 1st loss of an immediate family member. It was hard for all of us all, and I could see Daddy feeling the pain as he always assumed that he would go before Mommy. I could see him doing his best to hide his pain and show strength for the sake of us all. His words to me were that us as men must be strong for the sake of the woman in the family. It was his 68th birthday on the 30th August but that year, he forgot his birthday and she was buried the day after on 31st August. She would have turned 68 in October that year. It is now 24 years later, and I often noted how Daddy reminisce about her especially on family occasions which signified that he still missed her company after so many years. He often remarked on how the two of them tiled the living room walls and I think those walls were a stark reminder of her in his everyday life. Daddy did not say it in many words, but I think deep down, he is still mourned her and like a characteristic of the national bird of South Africa, The Blue Crane, she was... his partner for life.</p><br>

<p class="chapter">9.	Still strong in his old age.</p> 
<p>The old phrase made famous by Bettie Davis, “Old age is no place for sissies” most likely did not apply to Daddy for many years after his retirement. He was still a very strong man and remained very active around the household after retiring for many years. He often reminded me how his uncle Joe climbed onto the roof of his house at the age of 80 with relative ease, implying that he takes after his uncle. Uncle Joe ironically died at the age of 90 by virtue of prolonged injuries sustained after being knocked over by a negligent driver outside of the church he attended. The good man Uncle Joe was, he never laid any charges against the driver whom he regarded as a fellow parishioner, and I suppose he also did not realize that he will succumb to the injuries much later. Daddy always emphasized the role Uncle Joe played in his life and always showed his gratitude towards his uncle and I understood his perspective and I am glad for being willing to have been the driver for his visits whenever possible.<br><br> 
When we were hit by a global pandemic COVID19, our main concern, as repeatedly advised by the National Coronavirus Command Council that the elderly is most at risk of contracting the virus and could possibly succumb to it. When the vaccine became available, Daddy with the assistance from Marilyn and Mantos went for the 1st dose without hesitation and not paying attention to the conspiracy theories going around. This to me demonstrated the maturity and open-mindedness Daddy always displayed throughout his life. His words to me were that we have to do what we must to survive this pandemic. <br><br>
I think it was Fri 09 July 2021 a week before he was due for his 2nd jab, when I got a call from Shaun saying that Daddy was not well and that his breathing seems out of the ordinary. The immediate reaction was to get him to a doctor, but Shaun indicated that he is showing signs of stubbornness and implies that he will do so if not better the next day. After speaking to him telephonically myself, I could sense that he is very sick and knowing that Emilio is recovering from the virus at Ashford’s house, it was very possible that he could be positive, and I think that was a thought he did not want to endure. With Ashford and Shaky already in the window period after recovering, it was a very good idea from them to be the ones to take him to hospital and not wait. <br><br>
It was painful to learn that he was sitting in a wheelchair at Helen Joseph Hospital for over 12 hours. Although he was attended to and medicated through a drip for all this time, it was concerning taking his age into account. It was slightly comforting knowing that family members like Sean, Nettie, Maxine, Byron, Bryan and others alternated to make him as comfortable as possible under unusual circumstances while waiting for a bed to become available. When I eventually managed to speak with him telephonically from Cape Town and knowing that he is not in a good place, he tried his best to assure me that he is fine and that we should not be too concerned. In doing so, to me this indicated that he placed our wellbeing ahead of his and this to me was very noble and again under such trying circumstances.<br><br>  
When he was confirmed as COVID19 positive, it came as a shock to us all although we knew the possibilities were great and our concerns became even greater. Daddy also took this very hard as he immediately realized that this could be fatal, but his remarkable strength was once more proven, and he walked out of the hospital after three weeks as one of only a few 92-year-olds worldwide to recover from the Delta strain of COVID19. When I spoke to him from Cape Town on the day, he jokingly reminded me that he remains “The last man standing” as often referred to him by the late “Howza” Sandows.</p>
<section id="Epilogue">
<p class="chapter"> 10.	Epilogue</p>
<p> As Daddy was steadily and painfully reaching the end of his time on earth, and he did not hide this fact either and constantly acknowledged it, one could see through his pain and distress that he wanted to put those around at ease by always trying to prepare all of us for the inevitable by gently conveying the message that he is ready to go. We could see in his demeanor that he has spiritually dealt with whatever is required before his departure. He has confidently on numerous occasions advised me that he has accepted his fate and just as confidently told me that he is ready. He has outlived many of his peers and family members and many much younger than him more so during the pandemic. A point he often and sadly remarked on after such occurrence. <br><br>
Daddy has lived his life in a very dignified, diligent, graceful and in as much of an exemplary manner as he could. He gave of his every being for his children and without question, tried his best to support and provide for his children and indirectly also his grandchildren. He always indevoured to teach us to do what is right and to support each other. The values we all hold was instilled in us by his discipline. He had his own style and ways of enforcing discipline and some of us may have disagreed with it at times, but he did it in the best way he thought appropriate and in the interest of us all for the sake of survival, noting that the environment in which we grew up demanded a different type of guidance.<br><br>
I often think perhaps if he was not as strict, Shaun and I could have found ourselves messed up in one way or another and possibly sucked into the criminal indiscretions or the many forms of substance abuse so many of our friends and acquaintances have fallen prey to.  <br><br>
Yes, Daddy had his own ways with which he has come a long way and with which he strived to provide and guide his family and this I feel was the only way he knew and could not be changed easily after so many years. He lived life in a dignified manner and during his time on earth a greater family which consist of 8 children, 21 grandchildren and 28.5 great grandchildren evolved.<br><br>   
The three pillars on which we as a family has always lived by are unity, respect, and love for each other. This is a legacy set and by which we remember and honor Mommy and Daddy. It will be a sad day when this legacy is forgotten and totally faded.</p>
